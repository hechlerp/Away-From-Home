## Contributing

To start, clone or fork the repository. Please make all changes in your own scene, as to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.
Once you've finished, make a pull request against master, which needs approval from one collaborator to get merged.

## Making Pull Requests (for those unfamiliar with Git/Unity workflow)

In order to make a pull request, start by make a separate branch locally. Write your code, commit to it, and push it to a remote branch
of the same name. Github should then prompt you to make a pull request. If not, go to the pull requests tab, and click to add a new one.
Compare your branch against master, and write a message detailing what the pull request is for. Feel free to assign reviewers if you think
one person in particular should look at it. If there are potential merge conflicts or changes on your branch, please pull from master and
resolve the issues locally, then push the changes to the same branch.

Once your pull request is merged, feel free to delete your local branch.
